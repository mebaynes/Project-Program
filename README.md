# What is "The Great Coding Challenge?"

The Great Coding Challenge is a personal project to complete a semester long course every week, as inspired by Scott Young's [MIT Challenge](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/).

The goal is to complete the following courses by January 15, 2018:

- [PennX SD1x: Software Development Fundamentals](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:PennX+SD1x+2T2017/course/)
- [PennX SD2x: Data Structures and Software Design](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:PennX+SD2x+2T2017/course/)
- [Princeton University Algorithms I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1)
- [Princeton University Algorithms II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2)
